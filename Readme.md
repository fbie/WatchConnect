# Watch Connect #

Forked from [github.com/StevenHouben/WatchConnect](https://github.com/StevenHouben/WatchConnect).

Short note on how to make this build:

- Install a version of MSCV 2010 for C#
- Download and install [Microsoft XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)
- Download and install [Microsoft Surface SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26716)

That should be all of the dependencies.
